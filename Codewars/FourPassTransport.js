  The eccentric candy-maker, Billy Bonka, is building a new candy factory to produce his new 4-flavor sugar pops. 
  The candy is made by placing a piece of candy base onto a conveyer belt which transports the candy through four separate processing stations in sequential order. 
  Each station adds another layer of flavor.

  Due to an error in the factory blueprints, the four stations have been constructed in incorrect locations. 
  It's too costly to disassemble the stations, so you've been called in.

  Arrange the directional path of the conveyer belt so that it passes through each of the stations in 
  sequential order while also traveling the shortest distance possible.

	//your code goes here. you can do it!
  console.log(stations)
